Turn off Instant Pot. Add bones, onion, ginger, and garlic to the Instant Pot,&nbsp;then cover with 6 cups of water. Add brown sugar, fish sauce, and a big pinch of kosher salt, and give it a slight stir to combine. Top everything with the brisket and add just enough water to cover without going above the max pressure line in the Instant Pot.",

            "When the soup is done, carefully release the steam valve and allow for the Instant Pot to depressurize and for the steam to release. This can take a little while, so just be patient!",
            " When done, set aside the cooked brisket and strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer into a pot or move the broth to a container and store in the fridge for up to 5 days.",
            "OPTIONAL: For an extra clear, less fatty broth, allow the broth to cool in the fridge for 4 hours or overnight and remove the layer of fat that will have solidified on top of your broth."
